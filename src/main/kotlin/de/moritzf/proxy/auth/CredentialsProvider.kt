 * own when an embedder injects its own provider. It only asks for headers and, on a
 * 401, asks the provider to refresh.
 *
 * [AuthManager] is the default file-based implementation used by the CLI. The IDE
 * plugin supplies an implementation backed by its secure-storage auth service so that
 * token refresh is owned entirely by the preexisting login/refresh logic.
