/**
 * True when the failure was caused by the client going away mid-response (agent cancelled the
 * completion, editor closed the connection, broken pipe) instead of a real server or upstream
 * fault.
 *
 * Detection is type-based on purpose: upstream calls use `java.net.http.HttpClient`, so a Ktor
 * byte-channel failure can only originate from the client-facing socket. Matching on messages
 * such as "Broken pipe" would also swallow genuine upstream transport errors, which must still be
 * reported to the client as a 5xx.
