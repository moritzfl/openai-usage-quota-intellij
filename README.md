Track and use your LLM subscriptions directly in IntelliJ IDEA.

- **See your quota** for ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Copilot & more in the status bar and a detail popup.
- **Use your subscriptions from IDE chat** via MCP tools: quota lookup, web search, image and video generation, voice, and document-to-markdown.
- **Reuse your subscriptions in other tools** through a local OpenAI-compatible proxy (for example as a custom LLM provider for JetBrains Junie).
- **Keep AI client configs in sync** with IntelliJ's MCP server URL, which changes port between restarts.

## Supported providers

| Provider | Sign-in | Quota | Web search | Images | Video | Voice | Docs | Proxy |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

- **Quota** — usage in the status bar and detail popup.
- **Web search** — MCP tool that searches the web with your subscription. Copilot Chat can Bing-search in GitHub's own UI, but Copilot has no callable search API we can wrap.
- **Images** / **Video** — MCP tools that generate images or video with your subscription.
- **Voice** — MCP tools for speech-to-text and text-to-speech. (✓) means only one of the two.
- **Docs** — MCP tool that converts a PDF or image to markdown. ✓ uses a dedicated OCR API that returns figures. (✓) uses a chat/vision API and reconstructs figure images locally from estimated page boxes.
- **Proxy** — available through the local OpenAI-compatible proxy (for use of subscriptions in tools like Jetbrains AI Chat and other tools that require authentication by endpoint and API key).

Claude is quota-only. Anthropic does not allow using a Claude subscription outside their own apps, so this plugin only shows usage and does not wrap Claude search, media, documents, or a proxy.

## Installation

Open IntelliJ IDEA `Settings` > `Plugins` > `Marketplace`, search for **LLM Subscription Usage**, and click Install.

## Quick start

1. Open `Settings` > `Tools` > `LLM Subscription Usage`.
2. Sign in or add credentials for the providers you use.
3. Done — the status bar widget now shows your quota. Click it for the detail popup.

Everything else is optional and lives in the same settings page: MCP tools, MCP server URL sync, and the local proxy.

## Quota tracking

**Status bar widget** — a compact indicator shows your quota at a glance. Hover for a quick summary, click for the full popup. You can also place the indicator in the main toolbar instead.

![Status bar icon](docs/quota-statusbar-icon.png) ![Status bar with percentage](docs/quota-statusbar-percentage.png) ![Status bar with cake diagram](docs/quota-statusbar-cake.png)

**Detail popup** — one block per login, with usage windows, next reset times, and last refresh timestamps. Reorder accounts in settings (the list on the left); the popup follows that order.

Quotas refresh automatically every 5 minutes, plus on login and when opening the popup. Credentials — OAuth tokens, API keys, and session cookies — are stored in IntelliJ Password Safe.

## MCP tools for IDE chat

The plugin registers subscription-backed tools with IntelliJ's built-in MCP server. They are available to the IDE's AI chat — and to any external agent or AI harness that connects to IntelliJ's MCP server (Codex CLI, OpenCode, and others):

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `subscription_quota` | Current usage for any configured provider (optional `account` when you have more than one login of that type) |
| `subscription_tools_status` | Which accounts and tools are ready to use |
| `codex_web_search` | Web search answered by OpenAI/Codex (context size, live access, domain filters) |
| `supergrok_web_search` | Web search answered by Grok (model selection, domain filters) |
| `mistral_web_search` | Answer-style web search via Mistral Conversations |
| `subscription_web_search` | Result-list web search via Kimi, Z.ai, MiniMax, or Ollama |
| `subscription_document_to_markdown` | Convert a PDF/image to markdown via Mistral OCR, Z.ai GLM-OCR, OpenAI/Codex, or SuperGrok. Native OCR providers extract figures; Codex/SuperGrok crop figure regions locally from vision-estimated boxes |
| `subscription_image_generation` | Image generation via OpenAI/Codex, SuperGrok/xAI Imagine, Mistral, Z.ai GLM-Image, or MiniMax. Returns a download URL or writes a file; never base64 |
| `subscription_speech_to_text` | Transcribe audio via OpenAI/Codex, SuperGrok/xAI, Mistral, or Z.ai |
| `subscription_text_to_speech` | Generate speech audio via OpenAI/Codex, SuperGrok/xAI, Mistral, or MiniMax and write it to a file |
| `subscription_list_voices` | List OpenAI/Codex, SuperGrok/xAI, Mistral, or MiniMax voices |
| `subscription_video_generation` | Video generation via SuperGrok/xAI Imagine or Z.ai CogVideoX |
| `supergrok_video_generation` | SuperGrok/xAI Imagine video (same as `subscription_video_generation` with SUPERGROK) |

Individual tools can be enabled or disabled under `Settings` > `Tools` > `MCP Server` > `Exposed Tools`.

## MCP server URL sync

IntelliJ's built-in MCP server may change its port between restarts, which breaks AI clients (OpenCode, Codex CLI, and others) that store the server URL in their own config files.

The plugin can keep those configs pointed at the active endpoint: enable `Sync IntelliJ MCP server URL to JSON/TOML/YAML files` in settings, pick one or more config files, and select the property to update. The settings page also shows whether IntelliJ's MCP server is running, stopped, disabled, or unavailable.

![MCP server sync settings](docs/mcp-sync-settings.png)

## OpenAI-compatible proxy

The plugin can run a local proxy that exposes your subscriptions through standard OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` where supported, `/v1/models`, plus LiteLLM-style `/v1/model/info`). Any tool that speaks the OpenAI API or expects a LiteLLM server can then use your subscriptions. Compatibility is tested with the Junie CLI and with JetBrains' own API Connections for AI features (such as the integrated AI chat).

**Setup:** open the **Proxy** tab in `Settings` > `Tools` > `LLM Subscription Usage`, tick `Enable local subscription proxy`, choose the providers to expose, and apply. Then use `Copy Base URL` and `Copy API Key` to configure your client.

**Good to know:**

- Configure clients with the base URL **without** a `/v1` suffix (for example `http://127.0.0.1:14621`) — clients append `/v1/...` themselves, and all routes also answer unprefixed.
- For JetBrains Junie, add the proxy as a LiteLLM provider with that base URL and the copied API key; available models are discovered automatically.
- The API key is generated locally and stored in IntelliJ Password Safe. Provider credentials never leave the plugin's regular secure storage.
- `Log requests and responses to disk` writes full request/response bodies to a temp folder for debugging. Off by default; logs are pruned automatically (7 days / 2000 files).

![Proxy settings](docs/proxy-settings.png)

The proxy implementation was derived from the initial proxy design of [AIProxyOauth](https://github.com/skanga/AIProxyOauth), adapted to Kotlin and extended for this plugin's multi-provider subscription proxy, broader client compatibility, model discovery, request/response translation, and additional OpenAI-compatible routes.

## How it works

The plugin calls each provider's usage API with your credentials and displays the result in a normalized format. Nothing is sent anywhere except to the providers you configured.

Settings is an account list: add or remove logins, including more than one of the same type. Drag to reorder. The detail pane shows the raw `Last quota response` exactly as it arrived from the API — useful for transparency, debugging, and bug reports. Add, remove, default, and standby wait until Apply.

## Troubleshooting

**"Port 1455 is already in use"** — another process is using the OpenAI login callback port. Stop it and retry the login.

**"Not logged in"** — open the plugin settings and start the sign-in flow for that provider again.

**Quota fetch errors or wrong numbers** — providers occasionally change their API responses. Check `Last quota response` in the provider's settings page to see what the API actually returned, and please [open an issue](https://github.com/moritzfl/llm-subscription-usage-intellij/issues/new/choose) with that response attached (redact anything you consider sensitive first). This is usually all that is needed to fix a parsing problem.
